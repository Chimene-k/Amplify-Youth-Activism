# Amplify-Youth-Activism
AMPLIFY is a place for learning, taking action, and connecting with other young people invested in making a lifelong commitment to activism.

I created this page as a forum for youth to learn about activism and organizations that they can get involved in. There has been a lack of emphasis on being an upstanding global citizen in my school education. We are all global citizens: citizens of the world. Our world includes a beautiful range of many different people from many different places and backgrounds. Being a responsible global citizen means standing up against racism, sexism, homophobia, imperialism, colonial structures, etc as a part of this world. Everyone has a role in making the revolutionary changes our world needs. We should all be learning to stand up for what believe in and dedicate our lives to being upstanders.

Activism needs to be a necessary part of our lives: education, work, families, social life, and more.

We need as many people as possible to be on board in order to make change occur in this world. I named this site AMPLIFY because I think we should all be encouraged to increase the volume on our activism. Being an activist is something that should make you proud. We need to AMPLIFY our own activism and AMPLIFY the activism of others. You will find tools here to effectively AMPLIFY the volume of your activism. AMPLIFY is a place for learning, taking action, and connecting with other young people invested in doing the work to make this world a place where everyone is safe and comfortable. A place where everyone belongs.
