            <h1> Step 2: Reflect and Absorb </h1>
        <h3> Here, we will reflect on what we have learned so far and figure out how to apply what we learn to our activism. We will navigate the process in 
            three stages: Internal Reflection, Absorb, and Apply to Action. </h3>

        <h2> Internal Reflection </h2>
        <p> This stage is going to be all about asking yourself questions and internalizing the lessons and information you have learned.
            This process will likely involve introspection: the examination or observation of one's own mental and emotional processes. 
            This part of the process is completely reliant on you. You are stepping inside to 
            Question yourself about what biases you hold, what things surprised you in your research, what things resonated with you.
            The questions below can help you
