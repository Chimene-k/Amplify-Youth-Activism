        <h1> First Step: Learn!    </h1>

        <h3> Here, we will learn ways to stay involved in activism, educate ourselves, and create change within our communities. 
            The community could be as small as your immediate family or as large as the American continent. 
            Collaborating with others is key in raising awareness about issues you want to tackle. Let’s talk about it. </h3>
        
            <section class="learning"> 
            <h2> Educating Yourself </h2> 
            <p> Before diving into activism, you must learn about history and language related to that issue. 
                Even if you already have a framework of relevant information and perspectives, it will benefit you to 
                browse a few sources as you get started. </p> 
            <p>
                An easy place to begin this learning is online! Use the internet to find a range of resources: artwork, literature, 
                articles, movies, videos, and more. You should also try to find a range of perspectives on the issue.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Next, ask family, friends, neighbors, teachers, and other people you have access to about the issue. You should not only
                look to <quote> "experts" </quote> for guidance. Of course, it is important to look to people who have spent 
                significant time diving into the issue. However, they are not the <em> only </em> people you should get information from. There should not be a criteria
                for who has the ability to share valuable knowledge and teach others. Decolonize your mindset by looking to different people from different backgrounds for knowledge.
                Talk to people affected by the issue and see what they think, feel, and share. Talk to family and friends to 
                contextualize the issue and understand how it affects (or does not affect) those in your immediate circles.
                Talk to people you do not know very well about the issue! It is never helpful to limit yourself to the same group of people.
                Sharing with and listening to different kinds of people should not be an extraordinary task. Normalize conversations
                with a (racially, religiously, economically, etc) diverse range of people as you learn.
                 </p>
            
            <p> Social media is another great place to learn about the issue you want to focus on. 
                However, it would be wise to fact check the information you find on social media via a reliable source: newspaper, teacher,
                internet archive, etc.
                Social media is a great place to interact with people from different backgrounds because it is accessible to
                so many different people. 
                Just stay away from using social media as your <em> only </em> source of information.
                It is best to look at a variety of sources as you learn.
            </p>
            <p> Make sure your process of education includes learning about government as well. There are local, state, and national levels of the government.
                Make sure you know the congressperson for your district. Local officials are often overlooked by those searching for change. Every level of the government has a role
                and needs to be included in your research. Make sure you know about judges, lawmakers, senators, law enforcement leaders in your state.
            There are many levels to look at. It would be best to start by looking at what has been going on so far related to the issue you are focusing on. Look at
        the track records of officials in terms of addressing the issue. Local officials have influence too and local government can be the starting point or focus of your activism to
    create concrete changes. There is revolutionay change necessary to get our countries to the ideal condition for everyone. In order to create this change,
we must still work to understand the past. We must work to understand existing structures, processes, and institutions. Then we must apply that knowledge 
to create change.  </p>

            <h2> Ground Yourself </h2>
            <p> Here are some helpful terms to keep in mind throughout your process exploring and learning about activism:
            </p>
            <ul class="section lists"> 
                <li> Ally: takes action to help and understand members of a marginalized group
                </li>
                <li> Advocate: acts on behalf of others, gives a voice, speaks up for a cause
                </li>
                <li> Co-Conspirator: helps to plan and act on a goal
                </li>
                <li> Activist: someone who works to bring attention and action, actively speaking up and working toward a goal </li>
                <li> Accomplice: someone who is an ally, then actually shows up, taking part of the risk away when you have more privilege</li>
                <li> Collaborator: partnership in taking action, raising awareness, planning, etc</li>

            </ul>

            <h2> Recognizing Privilege </h2>
            <p> Privilege: “a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group.”
            </p>
            <p> Remember, having a privilege doesn’t mean you have not experienced challenges or oppression due to a certain part of your identity. 
                Everyone has some kind of privilege to reflect on.
            </p>
            <p> Another reminder: If you have less privilege due to an identity, it is NOT your job to educate others with more privilege in that area. 
                For example, if you are Black, do not feel pressured to educate a white person about allyship at the expense of your well being. 
                Remind others about the power of the internet and tell them you are not up to educating them at the moment!
            </p>
            <p> When approaching activism, it is very important to acknowledge and reflect on your privileges in life. 
                A privilege could be connected to any core identifier: gender, ability, race, age, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socio-economic status/class, etc. Being cisgender is a privilege related to gender to acknowledge and reflect on. Being white is a privilege related to race to acknowledge and reflect on. Being able to hear and see without any significant challenge is a privilege related to ability to acknowledge and reflect on. 
            </p>
            <p> Reflecting on your privilege occurs after acknowledging your privileges. Think about what your privilege means to you, how it benefits you, and how it affects others. Here are some helpful questions to ask: What do I have because of this privilege? What does this privilege mean to others when we interact? How can I use this privilege to help others? What structures make sure I have this privilege and others do not? When has this privilege allowed me to overlook the needs of others? Am I ever defensive or uncomfortable when others bring up this privilege? Talk to others that share your privilege about how you can be helpful to others that do not share the privilege. Listen to others that do not share your privilege and hear what they have to say. Remember not to expect others without your privilege to explain things for you or answer all of your questions. That is your job, not theirs. You have to be flexible and look to many different places and people as you reflect on your privilege. 
            </p>
            <p> After reflecting, apply the knowledge you have gained to create change and join others. When you are a more privileged member of a group, take more time to listen or use your privilege to help the group’s activism. Now that you have been reflecting on your own privilege, you can give others guidance to do the same. Use your voice to challenge others with similar privileges to join and amplify activist efforts. Accept criticism and use it to do better moving forward. You are committing to a lifelong process of learning, no one can understand everything about privilege and activism after one week of learning or one epiphany. If the privilege you identify and reflect on does not significantly relate to your activism, you can still use this process to remain self reflective and self challenging.

            <p> Research all the companies that own the products you use: clothing, skincare, school supplies, etc. It doesn't take 
                much time to find more information! Many mainstream, large companies use unethical
