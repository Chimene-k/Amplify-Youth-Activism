    <h1> Step 2: Reflect and Absorb </h1>
    <h3> Here, we will reflect on what we have learned so far and figure out how to apply what we learn to our activism.
        We will navigate the process in
        three stages: Internal Reflection, Absorb, and Apply to Action. </h3>

    <section>
        <h2> Internal Reflection </h2>
        <p> This stage is going to be all about asking yourself questions and internalizing the lessons and information
            you have learned.
            This process will likely involve introspection: the examination or observation of one's own mental and
            emotional processes.
            This part of the process is completely reliant on you. You are stepping inside of yourself. You need to be
            honest, brave, and open.
            When I say be open, I mean: be open to constant growth, uncomfortable moments, facing insecurity.
            Ultimately, learning to be vulnerable is a part of this internal reflection.
            Don't expect this to be an easy or short reflection. You will need to take time reflect for the rest of your
            life!
            Everything doesn't need to click for you after one day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Question yourself about what biases you hold, what things surprised you in your research, what things
            resonated with you.
            The questions below can help you with your internal reflection:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li> What made me uncomfortable during my self-education process? Why? </li>
            <li> What surprised me as I researched this issue? Why? </li>
            <li> What/who did I disagree with as I researched? Why? </li>
            <li> Did my perspective on anything related to this issue change? Why? </li>
            <li> What resonated with me as I researched this issue? </li>
            <li> Who did I relate to as I listened to people discuss this issue? </li>
            <li> What biases did I discover within myself during this self-education process? </li>

        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> Absorb </h2>
        <p> This step involves actually taking time to adapt your habits and thinking to include important lessons you
            have learned.
            Knowing facts about climate change, mass incarceration, etc is not enough. You need to soak in what you have
            learned so
            that you can apply it to smaller, individual interactions and how you examine the world around you. These
            big issues
            we tackle have effects on many parts of our lives. Make sure you take the lessons you learn to heart. Don't
            totally remove
            the emotional part from how you think about information you have learned. The knowledge of academic
            subjects, data,
            and laws is not the only thing you need. You need to value human relationships and the impact of these
            issues on
            the people in your world. Look past the numbers and words on a page. Empathize with others, think, and feel.
            Explore how
            what you have learned can inform your way of thinking and everyday interactions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> Apply to Action </h2>
        <p> Now, the moment you've been waiting for: taking action! You have learned what the biggest issues are, what
            you feel passionate about,
            and what others think about this issue. There are many ways to approach activism. Feel free to try different
            approaches and mix things up along the way.
            Overall, you should be thinking about: ways to mobilize others to amplify your efforts, who you can work
            with to form a gameplan, and
            where your activism will take place (virtually, in person, at school, in your neighborhood, through art,
            through writing, etc).
            Think about these questions: Who? What? Where? When? How? Those should get you started in shaping the
            concrete work you will do.
            The goal is to turn what you have learned into concrete action. Work with other activists to amplify your
            efforts and push for
            revolutionary changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em> Action through education</em> <br>You can share what you have learned and help to educate others and
            encourage them
            to engage in activism. In school, you can work with other students to organize activities and events that
            educate the community
            about the issue you have been focusing on. Host a teach in where you and your classmates can educate
            yourselves about the issue and
            discuss concrete ways the community can stay involved in the cause moving forward. You could reach out to
            ask an activist
            to visit your school and talk about their work with a group of students. You can seek their advice about
            involving the community
            in activism.
        </p>
        <p> If there are issues within your school community that need to be addressed, you can also focus your
            activism on speaking up and prompting concrete changes to better your community. Reach out to adult allies
            and classmates in order to
            make plans to connect with your head of school, board of trustees, community leaders, etc. Outline the
            changes that you want them to make
            and hold them accountable for implementing those changes. Reach out to students at other schools
            encountering similar issues and work with them.
            Find strength in numbers! Your combined effort will bring attention to the issues at your school and help
            you gain momentum.
        </p>

        <p> <em> Action through protest </em> <br>
            You can join demonstrations in your area to call for legislative reform, mobilize others, or call attention
            to

        </p>
