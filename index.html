        <h2 style="font-size: 50px; color: gray">About </h2>

        <p> I created this page as a forum for youth to learn about activism and organizations that they can get involved in. 
            There has been a lack of emphasis on being an upstanding global citizen in my school education. 
            We are all global citizens: citizens of the world.
            Our world includes a beautiful range of many different people from many different places and backgrounds.
            Being a responsible global citizen means standing up against racism, sexism, homophobia, imperialism, colonial structures, etc as a part of this world. 
            Everyone has a role in making the revolutionary changes our world needs. 
            We should all be learning to stand up for what believe in and dedicate our lives to being upstanders. 
            <p style="font-weight:bold"> <em> Activism needs be a necessary part of our lives: education, work, families, social life, and more. </em> <p> 
            We need everyone to be on board to make change occur in this world. 
            AMPLIFY is a place for learning, taking action, and connecting with other young people invested in doing the work to make this world a place where everyone is safe and comfortable. A place where everyone <em> belongs </em>.</p>
